# Churn-Prediction

* Churn prediction is the process of identifying customers who are likely to stop using a product or service.
* Machine learning (ML) is often used to build predictive models that analyze customer behavior and identify patterns that can be used to predict churn.
* ML algorithms can analyze customer data such as usage patterns, demographics, and customer interactions to identify the factors that lead to churn.
* By predicting which customers are likely to churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering incentives or personalized outreach.
* Churn prediction using ML is a powerful tool that can help businesses improve customer retention, reduce costs, and increase profitability.
